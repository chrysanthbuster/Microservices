# Microservices
microservices stuff
A mix of several book tutorial patched together by google and stackoverflow answers, it works, I can try my best to explain how it work but NO PROMISES!!! Feel free to pull this repo and ask me questions how it works. This project currently features a shopping cart REST application with API calls to a product microservices (The example they give was a fixed json file, BORING! so I wronte a simple product service myself in Java Spring-boot)

Configurations for the application is all default.
Run the product endpoint and it will listen on port 8080
Run the shopping cart application and it will make get requests to product endpoint
There is not much microservices (only 2 rightr now) at the moment, this is my active working project
